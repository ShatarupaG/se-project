# Smart Choices Application

This is a new web-based tool “Smart Choices”, for a client from the Department of Organizational Leadership, Purdue University. The Department of Organizational Leadership wants to educate its staff and students about leadership and decision-making. Leadership and psychology experiments can help students and staff improve by providing valuable insights into effective leadership strategies, team dynamics, and motivation techniques. These experiments can provide useful advice based on evidence that can be used in educational and professional settings to improve leadership skills, psychological well-being, and performance.
